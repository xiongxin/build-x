# Contributing to hh-clilib
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process

This project is developed in the 'master' branch on GitHub. Changes should be
submitted as pull requests.

Usually, versions will be tagged directly from master; if changes are needed to
an old release, a branch will be cut from the previous release in that series - e.g.
v1.2.3 might be tagged from a `1.2.x` branch.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes and the example still work
4. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
