The runtime is complaining about the duplicate keys because Person::getGender will return the gender of the
person as the key and you have many males and females.
The solution is to use the second version of the toMap() method to obtain the collection. It lets you specify a
merge function as a third argument. The merged function is passed the old and new values for the duplicate key.
The function is supposed to merge the two values and return a new value that will be used for the key. In your case,
you can concatenate the names of all males and females. The following snippet of code accomplishes this:

The first two versions of the toMap() method create the Map object for you. The third version lets you pass a
Supplier to provide a Map object yourself. I will not cover an example of using this version of the toMap() method.
Armed with two examples of collecting the data in maps, can you think of the logic for collecting data in a map
that summarizes the number of people by gender? Here is how you accomplish this:
